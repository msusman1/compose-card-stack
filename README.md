# Installation

To get a Git project into your build:

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```groovy
	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

Step 2. Add the dependency

```groovy
dependencies { 
    implementation "com.github.msusman1:compose-card-stack:1.0.1"
}
```

#Setup



```kotlin
    CardStack(
        modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp),
        stackState = rememberStackState(),
        cardElevation = 10.dp,
        scaleRatio = 0.95f,
        rotationMaxDegree = 15,
        displacementThreshold = 60.dp,
        animationDuration = Duration.NORMAL,
        visibleCount = 3,
        stackDirection = Direction.BottomAndRight,
        swipeDirection = SwipeDirection.FREEDOM,
        swipeMethod = SwipeMethod.AUTOMATIC_AND_MANUAL,
        items = items,
        onSwiped = { index ->
            Log.d(TAG, "onSwiped index:$index ")
        }
    ) {
        MyImageCard(item = it)  // your card Composable
    }

```

# Features

## Card Scale Ratio
Determine how much underline cards be scale down(from 0.0 to 1.0) value fo 0.95f means 90% of original size, [Default: 0.95]
